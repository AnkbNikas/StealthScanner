# StealthScanner

StealthScanner is a Python-based reconnaissance tool designed for ethical hacking and penetration testing. It performs various scanning and enumeration tasks in a stealthy manner to minimize detection. Here's a brief summary of its functionalities:

Get Target IP: Converts a given domain name to its corresponding IP address.

Stealth Port Scanning: Uses Nmap to perform a stealth port scan on the target IP, identifying open ports.

Service Enumeration: Uses Nmap to identify services running on the target IP's open ports.

OS Identification: Uses Nmap to identify the operating system of the target host.

Subdomain Enumeration: Uses Sublist3r to passively enumerate subdomains of the target domain.

DNS Records Verification: Uses nslookup to verify DNS records of the target domain.

Technology Detection: Uses WhatWeb to passively detect technologies used on the target website.

The main function combines all these tasks to provide a comprehensive overview of the target domain and its associated IP address. This information can be useful for penetration testers to identify potential vulnerabilities and plan further actions.

Hereâ€™s how you can get StealthScanner up and running:

Install Required Tools: Ensure you have the necessary tools installed on your system.

Nmap

Sublist3r

WhatWeb

You can install them using the following commands:

sudo apt-get install nmap
sudo apt-get install sublist3r
sudo apt-get install whatweb

Install Python Packages: Make sure you have Python and the required packages installed.

nmap

socket

You can install the nmap package using pip:

pip install python-nmap

Prepare the Script: Copy the StealthScanner script to a Python file, for example, stealth_scanner.py.

Set Target Domain: In the script, replace the placeholder domain with the actual domain you want to scan:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    domain = "example.com"  # Replace with the target domain
    enumerate_target(domain)

Run the Script: Execute the script in your terminal:

python stealth_scanner.py

This will start the scanning process and output the results of the target domain enumeration.
